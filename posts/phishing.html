      <p>
        Phishing attacks remain one of the most common and effective cyber threats targeting individuals and organizations worldwide.
        Attackers use deceptive emails, messages, and websites to trick victims into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">What is Phishing?</h2>
      <p>
        Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers masquerade as a trustworthy entity to manipulate victims into performing actions that compromise their security.
        These actions might include clicking malicious links, downloading infected attachments, or providing confidential information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">Common Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent emails impersonate legitimate companies, often with urgent calls to action.</li>
        <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted attacks personalized to a specific individual or organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing via SMS text messages, often including links or requests for personal info.</li>
        <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Voice phishing over phone calls impersonating banks or authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Clone Phishing:</strong> A legitimate email is cloned and altered with malicious links or attachments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">How to Recognize a Phishing Attempt</h2>
      <p>
        Recognizing phishing attempts can help you avoid falling victim. Look for these red flags:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Unexpected emails or messages from unknown senders or even familiar contacts but with unusual content.</li>
        <li>Generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your real name.</li>
        <li>Urgent language pressuring immediate action (e.g., "Your account will be closed!").</li>
        <li>Suspicious links with mismatched URLs when hovered over.</li>
        <li>Requests for sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or social security numbers.</li>
        <li>Emails containing attachments you did not expect or recognize.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">Real-Life Examples of Phishing Attacks</h2>
      <p>
        Several large-scale phishing campaigns have caused serious damage, including:

      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">Effective Defense Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        Protecting yourself and your organization from phishing requires a multi-layered approach:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Verify Senders:</strong> Always confirm the identity of the sender before responding or clicking links.</li>
        <li><strong>Hover Over Links:</strong> Check URLs by hovering your mouse over links to see if the address matches the legitimate site.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Adds an extra security layer beyond just passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your OS, browser, and antivirus software.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate Yourself & Others:</strong> Regular cybersecurity training and awareness programs can drastically reduce risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Email Filters & Security Tools:</strong> Anti-phishing filters and endpoint security solutions help block threats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">What to Do If You Suspect a Phishing Attack</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Do not click any links or download attachments.</li>
        <li>Report the suspicious email to your IT department or email provider.</li>
        <li>Change your passwords immediately if you think credentials were compromised.</li>
        <li>Monitor your bank and online accounts for unauthorized activity.</li>
        <li>Run a full antivirus scan on your devices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-cyan-300">Conclusion</h2>
